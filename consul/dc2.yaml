# This file contains Helm values for deploying Consul to the AKS cluster (datacenter dc2).
# It is used by the Terraform Helm provider to configure Consul for federation and service mesh demos.
# WARNING: This configuration disables ACLs and does not use gossip encryption. Do not use in production.

## WARNING! This Consul configuration disables ACLs and does not use gossip encryption. It should not be used in production environments.

# In Consul, two foundational security features you’ll almost always enable in production are ACLs (Access Control Lists) 
# 1. ACLs (Access Control Lists)

# What are they?
# Consul ACLs control who (which token) can read, write, or administer Consul data and operations—things like KV entries, service registrations,
# catalog queries, and even federation controls. Without ACLs, any client that can talk to your Consul HTTP API can create or destroy services,
# read secrets, or reconfigure your mesh.

# Key components
# Policies: Define sets of capabilities (e.g. “read-only on kv/”, “write on service registrations”).
# Tokens: Bearer tokens that carry a policy or combination of policies.
# Bootstrap token: A special token with full “management” rights used to create other tokens and policies.
# Replication token: Used to replicate ACL data between datacenters when federation is enabled.

# Why you need it
# Least‑privilege: Grant only the minimum rights that your applications or users need.
# Auditability: You can track which token—and therefore which application—made changes.
# Multi‑tenant isolation: Run separate services or teams in the same cluster without giving them carte blanche.

# 2. Gossip encryption
# Gossip encryption is a feature that allows you to encrypt the gossip protocol used by Consul to communicate between nodes. 
# This ensures that sensitive information is not exposed to unauthorized users.

# How to enable it
# 1. Enable gossip encryption
# 2. Configure gossip encryption
# 3. Restart Consul
